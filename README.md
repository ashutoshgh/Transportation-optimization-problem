# Transportation-optimization-problem
This repository contains the solution for a basic transportation optimization problem in R and Python

The transportation problem is a special type of linear programming problem where the objective consists 
of minimizing transportation cost of a given commodity from a number of sources or origins 
(e.g. factory, manufacturing facility) to a number of destinations(e.g.warehouse, store).

This problem has been taken from the book - **Introduction to Operations Research by Hillier / Lieberman** (Pg. 401)


Apologies for the table formatting in the Jupyter file but it still gives you the solution.
